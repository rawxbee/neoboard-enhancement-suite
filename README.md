# the settings cog
* No matter what combination of scripts you install, while you are on the neoboards a settings cog will appear on the left side of the bar that includes your neopoints/etc.

* This menu will give you quick access to the neoboard index, neoboard preferences and the neoboard-enhancement-suite.

*by rawbeee and sunbathr*

* Adds quicklink buttons to user-specific pages to the byline for each user within threads.

* Adds a reply button to the byline of each user, clicking this will instantly bring you to the reply text box and input the username of the user you are replying to (EG. '@rawbeee').

* Adds a refresh button to each reply and restyles the report button.

* For those who use neoboard pens, you will have the choice to set a pen to be remembered (the next pen you click will be remembered and autoselected across the neoboards) or to set your pens to random (each page refresh will randomly select a pen).

* Links to DTI closets or outfits will be embedded as clickable links

# enhanced-neoboard-smilies.user.js
*by sunbathr and rawbeee*

* Replaces the usual smilie section with several categories. Mouse over each category to browse the entire library of smilies available for posting on the neoboards. Click the smilie you want and it will be added to the text box.

* An empty character is available within general smilie category (the plus icon), this character can be inserted after links or other elements that generally break fonts to avoid breaking them.

* The final category does not insert emojis, but rather user-specific links. You can use these to quicklink others to your neomail/trades/auctions/shop/gallery. Empty characters are on either side of the link so you can submit as is without breaking your font.

* Any **http** links from images.neopets or pets.neopets will be embedded directly into replies. A search bar is available below the smilie section that can be utilized to find images to post.

# neoboard-follow-users.js
*by sunbathr and rawbeee*

* Adds a follow option to the byline of each user within threads. This button becomes an unfollow button for users you are following.

* Followed users will have a light green byline within threads to easily differentiate them from users you are not following (if you have followed/unfollowed a user in one tab and wish to make changes in another tab, make sure the second tab has been refreshed to ensure the previous changes aren't overwritten).

* ![](https://i.imgur.com/YfJZycn.png)

* In the list of threads on each neoboard, those created by followed users will appear underlined to easily differentiate them from those you are not following.

* ![](https://i.imgur.com/CcEyyog.png)

* You may choose to edit the color of the byline and underline through the settings cog

* ![](https://i.imgur.com/EWCKLcN.png)

* You can also block users by accesing the settings cog. Enter users in a comma seperated list (Ex: user1,user2,use3,user4). Their messages and threads will not appear for you.

# neoboard-bookmarks.user.js
*by sunbathr and rawbeee*

* Creates a customizable bookmark section at the top of the neoboards.

* Within each thread is a bookmark button, clicking this will add it to the collapsible menu. This button becomes an unbookmark button when you have bookmarked a thread. You may also unbookmark by clicking the X beside the thread within the collapsible menu (if you have bookmarked/unbookmarked a thread in one tab and wish to make changes in another tab, make sure the second tab has been refreshed to ensure the previous changes aren't overwritten).

* ![](https://i.imgur.com/ydv6oPT.png)

* You may also bookmark/unbookmark specific neoboards (Avatar Chat, Pound Chat, etc) by visiting the neoboard index (where you see the entire list of neoboards) and using the add/remove buttons. These bookmarked boards will appear above the collapsible menu (the previous warning about making changes across tabs applies here as well).
